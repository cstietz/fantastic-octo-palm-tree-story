Up in a tree there was a man. A man named Frost. Frost has never seen frost or anything that resembled frost since the tree he lived in was on a island. This island was quite warm some would call it hot but Frost had never been anywhere colder to realize.
One day Frost decided to leave his tree.  He traveled down the entire trunk until he reached the sand below. The sand was quite warmer than Frost remembered.
