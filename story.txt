Up in a tree there was a man. A man named Frost. Frost has never seen frost or anything that resembled frost since the tree he lived in was on a island. This island was quite warm some would call it hot but Frost had never been anywhere colder to realize.
One day Frost decided to leave his tree.  He traveled down the entire trunk until he reached the sand below. The sand was quite warmer than Frost remembered.
Frost began to walk down the beach and see what he could find - some frost perhaps? As he walked, he noticed a peak far in the distance. It looked very tall, and Frost wondered if he climbed it if he would be able to see the whole world. So Frost began walking towards the peak. When he arrived, there was a neat trail that looked like it led all the way up the mountain and Frost began to climb.
